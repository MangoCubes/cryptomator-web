# cryptomator-web
Access Cryptomator vault without installing a program on your PC. Useful if you are on a rush, or cannot install programs for whatever reason.

**It is strongly recommended that you do not use this as your primary vault access method. This is just an implementation of Cryptomator based on its security architecture in browser, and therefore should be considered as a trade-off between usability and security. Please do not use it for mission-critical stuff.**
